#Using Constants (π and e):#Use Case: You need π for calculating the area of a circle or e for
# certain statistical distributions or algorithms.

r=2
area_of_circle=math.pi * r**2

#Logarithmic Functions: Use Case: Logarithms are widely used in
# data scaling, data normalization, or in certain algorithms.
